//! (canonical-facade-52-plan.md §1). Owns config -> store/directory
//! selection and the router cap both `nmp-ffi` and `nmp-demo` used to
//! duplicate by hand.
//!
//! No `Signed`-payload verify lives here: that guarantee moved to
//! `nmp-engine::core::EngineCore::on_publish`'s acceptance boundary (Unit
//! A0, #56) precisely so it holds for every entry point -- this facade,

//! `inner` holds `Some(Inner)` while the engine is open, `None` once
//! [`Engine::shutdown`] has run. Every verb takes the SAME mutex, checks

//! lock or returns [`EngineError::EngineClosed`] immediately -- it never
//! reaches a raw `Handle` call that could race the engine thread's own exit
//! and panic through `Handle`'s internal `.expect(...)`s. `shutdown` takes
//! the same lock to `Option::take` it, so a verb call and a `shutdown` call
//! can never interleave: one strictly precedes the other. `Engine`'s `Drop`
//! calls `shutdown` too, so a dropped-without-`shutdown` `Engine` still
//! tears down `EngineThread` cleanly rather than detaching it.
